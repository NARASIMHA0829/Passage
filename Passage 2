Descriptive passages provide detail about people, places, things, or events. They are used to help the reader see, feel, and experience what is being described.

Descriptive passages can be found in both narrative and expository passages. However, they are usually more common in narrative passages because they help create a vivid picture for the reader.

One way to identify a descriptive passage is by its use of sensory language. Sensory language is a language that describes what something looks, smells, tastes, feels, or sounds like. If a passage is full of this type of language, the author is likely trying to describe something.

Another way to identify a descriptive passage is by its purpose. A descriptive passage is usually used to provide more information about a person, place, thing, or event.
